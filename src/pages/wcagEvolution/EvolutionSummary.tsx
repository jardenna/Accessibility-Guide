        The primary focus of WCAG 1.0 was on HTML, aiming to ensure that web
        content could be navigated and understood by all users, regardless of
        their physical or cognitive abilities. This initiative set the stage for
        future advancements in web accessibility, paving the way for more
        comprehensive and inclusive guidelines in subsequent versions.

        This updated version moved beyond basic HTML to include a wider range of
        web technologies. One of the most important advancements in WCAG 2.0 was
        the introduction of four core principles that still form the foundation
        of todayâ€™s WCAG standards. The release of WCAG 2.0 marked a significant
        moment in the journey towards a more inclusive digital world.
