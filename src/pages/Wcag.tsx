      In the mid-1990s, as the internet began shaping daily life, it became
      clear that many people with disabilities faced barriers online. To address
      this, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) established the Web
      Accessibility Initiative (WAI). Their goal is to systematically tackle
      these challenges.

      Rarely does a single document have such a direct impact on peopleâ€™s lives,
      but the guidance that WCAG provides allows developers and content creators
      to include people who have historically been excluded from digital
      experiences.

        Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web and director of W3C,
        has been a strong advocate for an inclusive internet. His vision of a
        universally accessible web has influenced W3C's initiatives, including
        WAI.

        WCAG standards are not laws themselves but are widely adopted globally.
        They serve as guidelines that governments and organizations use to make
        digital platforms more accessible.
