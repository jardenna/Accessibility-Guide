      eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y is an ESLint plugin that identifies and enforces a
      number of accessibility rules directly in your JSX. Using this in
      combination with a tool that tests the final rendered DOM, such as
      react-axe, can help you find and fix any accessibility concerns on your
      site.

          By tying up aria properties with styles (instead of adding custom
          classes) we ensure that other developers will most likely keep the
          aria values up to date. Otherwise, an engineer who is not experienced
          with accessibility might forget to update those values when
          refactoring the component.
